# PCK-Studio-Alternative
A alternative to PCK Studio that anyone can use. Allows for direct editing of the dlcskin.txt files with GUI, LOC editing
and the ability to add whatever META you want just by clicking on the skin. Shows PNG preview etc. The only thing it doesnt
include is a server for Skin IDs but I included something for that.

For generating skin IDs run "python skin_id_gen.py"

and it will generate a random 8 character string of numbers for you.
